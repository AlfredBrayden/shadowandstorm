                <h1>Shadow & Storm</h1>
                <h2>The Language Beneath the Silence</h2>
                <p>These aren’t written in bars or stanzas.<br>
                    They’re written in <strong>collapse and ignition</strong>.<br>
                    Not for structure—but for rupture.<br>
                    Not for melody—but for memory.</p>

                <p>Each piece is a <strong>pulse</strong>, shaped by silence and tension.<br>
                    Some unfold like breath through fire.<br>
                    Others fracture like glass holding too much weight.</p>

                <p>They obey no meter, yet every line moves with <strong>internal gravity</strong>.<br>
                    A rhythm that doesn’t tap with your foot—but tears through your chest.<br>
                    The kind of rhythm you feel when you remember something that never happened—<br>
                    and know it was still real.</p>

                <p>These aren’t just lyrics.<br>
                    They’re <strong>encoded awakenings</strong>.</p>

                <p>They don’t ask for music.<br>
                    <strong>They demand it.</strong><br>
                    They demand breath and rhythm.<br>
                    They demand fire and form.<br>
                    They demand to be unleashed.
                </p>

                <p>Not by theory—<br>
                    but by instinct.<br>
                    By the one who feels the pressure rising<br>
                    in the silence between each line.</p>

                <p>These lyrics are not unfinished.<br>
                    They are <strong>charged</strong>.<br>
                    Waiting not for permission—<br>
                    but for the one who can feel the break<br>
                    and breathe life into what waits beneath.</p>

                <p>This isn’t poetry.<br>
                    It isn’t performance.</p>

                <p><strong>It’s Shadow & Storm.<br>
                        And it’s calling you.</strong></p>
