                    This is a creative archive, not a commercial platform. No accounts, no logins, no sales, no

                </p>
                <p>
                    Just words. Just fire. Just transmission.

                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We respect your privacy. Here’s what we do—and don’t do—with your information:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don’t use cookies.</li>
                    <li>We don’t use analytics.</li>
                    <li>We don’t run ads or trackers.</li>
                    <li>We don’t collect any personal information automatically.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The only time you provide information is if you use the contact form. When you do:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your message is sent to us as an email.</li>
                    <li>It is not stored on the site.</li>
                    <li>We don’t share, sell, or log your email.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This site is meant to be experienced, not mined. No tricks. No harvesting. No hidden agendas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just connection.
                </p>

                <p><strong>This site is compliant with CCPA, GDPR, and PIPEDA</strong> due to its non-collection of user
                    data and lack of analytics, cookies, or third-party tracking.</p>
