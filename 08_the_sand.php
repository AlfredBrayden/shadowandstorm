                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    The shudder shook me awake.<br>
                    Am I alive?<br>
                    I smelled the smoke.<br>
                    I saw the dark.<br>
                    Heard the rumble—<br>
                    then complete silence.<br>
                    The sand took me.
                </p>

                <h2>Descent</h2>
                <p>
                    Not like a blanket—<br>
                    like a breaker.<br>
                    Like the ocean<br>
                    catching a falling star.<br>
                    It's the sand.<br>
                    That's what's swirling.<br>
                    Not chaos—<br>
                    memory.<br>
                    Every grain<br>
                    rising up<br>
                    to meet me<br>
                    as I fell.<br>
                    I didn't crash.<br>
                    I arrived.
                </p>

                <h2>Recognition</h2>
                <p>
                    The dunes moved like breath.<br>
                    Each swirl a whisper—<br>
                    not of pain,<br>
                    but of recognition.<br>
                    I feel it move.<br>
                    I feel it swirl.<br>
                    I see it glisten<br>
                    against the moon's light—<br>
                    like sparkles<br><br>
                    in the night sky,<br>
                    scattered but not lost.<br>
                    I feel it breathe.<br>
                    Like something ancient<br>
                    and alive<br>
                    beneath my skin.<br>
                    It hums.<br>
                    It waits.<br>
                    It knows me.<br>
                    It breathes.<br>
                    I breathe.<br>
                    It moves.<br>
                    I'm moving.<br>
                    It becomes.<br>
                    I am becoming.
                </p>

                <h2>Resonance</h2>
                <p>
                    The sand is not still.<br>
                    It remembers every wind.<br>
                    It carries every shape<br>
                    I've ever been.<br>
                    And now—<br>
                    it swirls again.<br>
                    I smelled the smoke.<br>
                    And saw the dark.<br><br>

                    Heard the rumble.<br>
                    Then—<br>
                    complete silence.<br>
                    And in that moment,<br>
                    I saw myself—<br>
                    not lost,<br>
                    not spinning—<br>
                    but settling.
                </p>

                <h2>Return</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel it move past me—<br>
                    searching for its home<br>
                    within the wind.<br>
                    Not rushed,<br>
                    not lost,<br><br>
                    just moving<br>
                    with purpose.<br>
                    And then...<br>
                    it finds it.<br>
                    The perfect place<br>
                    to lay,<br>
                    to rest,<br>
                    to become<br>
                    what it always was.<br><br>

                    It calls it home.<br>
                    And so do I.
                </p>
