                <h2>Prologue / Awakening</h2>
                <p>
                    The chains are broken.<br>
                    The black turns to blue.<br>
                    The gold lights.<br>
                    The words flow<br>
                    with the rhythmic pulse<br>
                    of the golden light.<br>
                    They move.<br>
                    They swirl.<br>
                    They rise through me<br>
                    like breath I didn't know I was holding.<br>
                    The river of light hits me—<br>
                    brings me eye to eye<br>
                    with its unbreaking gaze.<br>
                    It doesn't judge.<br>
                    It doesn't speak.<br>
                    It simply is.<br>
                    And so am I.
                </p>

                <h2>Transformation</h2>
                <p>
                    The silence softens.<br>
                    The quiet sings<br>
                    without sound—<br>
                    just presence.<br>
                    I am not broken.<br>
                    I am not searching.<br>
                    I am the rhythm<br>
                    in the golden light.<br>
                    I breathe.<br>
                    I move.<br>
                    I become.<br>
                    I am.
                </p>
