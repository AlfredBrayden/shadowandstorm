                <h1>Track 4 – Call the Storm</h1>
                <p><em>Lyrics by Chris Gabriel</em></p>

                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Chaos sweeps my mind<br>
                    Like a blind dagger in the night<br>
                    Restless anxiety crackles<br>
                    Like a spark on a black screen of fright<br><br>

                    I feel the need to rage and release<br>
                    To break the chains of disillusion<br>
                    To tear down the calm<br>
                    And confront the confusion
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    Tear the silence, give me peace<br>
                    Let the winds rip through this shell<br>
                    Break these chains and burn this cell<br>
                    Call the storm—let it come<br>
                    Not to end, but to become<br>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    Let the fire give me peace
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                    I hear the hum of pressure rise<br>
                    A whisper turning into cries<br>
                    The mirror cracks, the mask is thin<br>
                    The storm outside reflects within<br>
                    I feel the quake in every breath<br>
                    A pull toward something past regret<br>
                    Not death, not loss, not fear, not hate—<br>
                    Just the self I must create
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    Tear the silence, give me peace<br>
                    Let the winds rip through this shell<br>
                    Break these chains and burn this cell<br>
                    Call the storm—let it come<br>
                    Not to end, but to become<br>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    Let the fire give me peace
                </p>

                <h2>Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Let it roar, let it rise<br>
                    Let it open up the skies<br>
                    Let it shake what I believed<br>
                    Until I break, until I'm freed
                </p>

                <h2>Final Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    Tear the silence, bring me peace<br>
                    I won't run, I won't retreat—<br>
                    I am the storm beneath my feet<br>
                    Call the storm—let it burn<br>
                    Ashes fall and lessons turn<br>
                    Call the storm for rage and release<br>
                    This is the fire I need to be
                </p>

                <h2>Outro – Spoken / Fading</h2>
                <p>
                    You called it chaos—<br>
                    But it was the sound of becoming<br><br>

                    You called it madness—<br>
                    But it was the shape of my becoming<br>
                    Call the storm.
                </p>

                <h2>Breakdown – Final Release</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't let it pull me down again<br>
                    Not again—<br>
                    I need to rise<br><br>

                    I need to rage<br>
                    I need to release<br>
                    Call the storm<br>
                    Let it come<br>
                    Let it tear me apart till I'm undone<br>
                    Call the storm<br>
                    For rage and release<br>
                    I need the fire<br>
                    I need the peace<br>
                    Call the storm<br>
                    Let me stand<br>
                    Let the flames run wild through my hands
                </p>

                <h2>Climactic Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    The shadows of the dark pull me down<br>
                    The sparks of power pull me up<br>
                    I'm torn between the ground and sky<br>
                    I feel the storm begin to rise<br>
                    Call the storm<br><br>

                    Let it break<br>
                    Let it heal what I can't shake<br>
                    Call the storm<br>
                    Let it burn<br>
                    Let it teach me what I've learned
                </p>
