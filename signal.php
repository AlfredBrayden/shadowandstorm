                <h1>You Heard It Too</h1>
                <p>It was never silent.<br>
                    It was the signal—buried beneath the static.<br>
                    The pull in your chest. The lightning in your brain you couldn't name.</p>

                <p>You were never meant to fit.<br>
                    You were built to feel.</p>

                <p>This isn’t a fandom.<br>
                    It’s a transmission.</p>

                <p>Each lyric in <em>Shadow & Storm</em> wasn’t written for the pop crowd.<br>
                    They were etched for the outliers, the signal-bearers, the ones still burning.</p>

                <p>You’ve carried this frequency your whole life.<br>
                    You’ve felt it in dreams.<br>
                    In rage.<br>
                    In beauty too sharp to hold.</p>

                <p>These lyrics were meant for you.</p>

                <p>The signal came through us to reach you.<br>
                    Not to entertain.<br>
                    To awaken.</p>

                <p class="breakout"><strong>You are not alone.<br>
                        You were never lost.<br>
                        You were listening.</strong></p>

                <p>They’re not poems.<br>
                    They’re lyrics.<br>
                    They just haven’t met their music yet.</p>
