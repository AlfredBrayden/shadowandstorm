                <h1>Track 9 – The Last Verse</h1>
                <p><em>Lyrics by Chris Gabriel</em></p>

                <h2>Invocation</h2>
                <p>
                    The past is not set<br>
                    against the backdrop of raging time<br>
                    and the illusion<br>
                    of a forward journey.<br>
                    The music of the verse<br>
                    isn't written yet.<br>
                    It waits—<br>
                    for the last details.<br>
                    The resistance<br>
                    of the few<br>
                    where there were many before.
                </p>

                <h2>Observation</h2>
                <p>
                    The ages are dark<br>
                    and cold<br>
                    to the future.<br>
                    The sky is bleak<br>
                    and uninviting.<br>
                    Not because there is no hope—<br>
                    but because it no longer pretends<br>
                    to offer safety<br>
                    in motion.
                </p>

                <h2>Call</h2>
                <p>
                    What was once called progress<br>
                    now echoes like silence<br>
                    after the scream.<br>
                    Sing the music of the future—<br>
                    for they are lost.<br>
                    They need to be found.<br>
                    Sing for them.<br>
                    They need to be found.<br>
                    Not by maps,<br>
                    not by stars,<br>
                    but by memory<br>
                    that refuses to die.
                </p>

                <h2>Hope</h2>
                <p>
                    The future is not locked.<br>
                    But it is cold.<br>
                    And silent.<br>
                    They are lost.<br>
                    Sing for them.<br>
                    Guide them home.<br>
                    Not to what we were—<br>
                    but to what we remembered<br>
                    in the fire.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Transmission</h2>
                <p>
                    So we can be many again.<br>
                    So we can burn again.<br>
                    So we can rise<br>
                    from silence<br>
                    into song.<br>
                    Sing for them.<br>
                    To guide them.<br>
                    To the fire.<br>
                    Where truth still glows<br>
                    beneath the ash.<br>
                    The music will bring them.<br>
                    Just sing it.<br>
                    Guide them.
                </p>
