                <p><em>Lyrics by Chris Gabriel</em></p>

                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I wasn't meant to be here,<br>
                    I'm lost but never found,<br>
                    Chasing something I can't name,<br>
                    A call without a sound.
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    There's a piece of me I'm missing,<br>
                    In the cracks, I feel it twistin',<br>
                    A shattered mirror, broken wide,<br>
                    I'm searching for what's deep inside.
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a nomad on the run,<br>
                    Chasing shadows in the sun,<br>
                    A piece that slips from reach,<br>
                    I rise, but never breach<br>
                    The place where I belong—<br>
                    Still searching for the missing song.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Wandering, no map, no home,<br>
                    But something pulls me on alone,<br>
                    A journey's end I haven't seen,<br>
                    But I feel it in my veins, in my dreams.
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    There's a piece of me I'm missing,<br>
                    In the cracks, I feel it twistin',<br>
                    A shattered mirror, broken wide,<br>
                    I'm searching for what's deep inside.
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a nomad on the run,<br>
                    Chasing shadows in the sun,<br>
                    A piece that slips from reach,<br>
                    I rise, but never breach<br>
                    The place where I belong—<br>
                    Still searching for the missing song.
                </p>

                <h2>Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not lost, I'm just waitin',<br>
                    The pieces slowly shapin',<br>
                    When I find it, I'll be whole,<br>
                    But for now, I'll keep my soul.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a nomad on the run,<br>
                    Chasing shadows in the sun,<br>
                    A piece that slips from reach,<br>
                    I rise, but never breach<br>
                    The place where I belong—<br>
                    Still searching for the missing song.
                </p>
