                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>
                    its not dark.<br>
                    its not light.<br>
                    its chaos<br>
                    wanting balance without decay.<br>
                    No dilution. No retreat.<br>
                    Just the storm<br>
                    rising<br>
                    in the rhythm of my breath.<br><br>

                    It is not fury.<br>
                    It is not fear.<br>
                    It is the shape<br>
                    of what I cannot contain.
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Is it me?<br>
                    Or is it fire?<br>
                    Is it hunger?<br>
                    Or is it higher?<br>
                    Something breaks but not apart.<br>
                    Something screams but not from pain.
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me be the force unbound.<br>
                    Not to destroy<br>
                    but to ignite.<br>
                    Let the feeling of power rage<br>
                    without a leash, without a cage.<br>
                    This is not anger<br>
                    this is becoming.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Reverberation<br>
                    of all I am<br>
                    released in one<br>
                    violent bloom.<br><br>

                    Blood flows.<br>
                    Fire burns.<br>
                    Rage becomes rhythm<br>
                    and passion becomes pulse.<br><br>

                    It surges through my veins<br>
                    not poison, not power<br>
                    but everything I ever silenced<br>
                    screaming<br>
                    for release.
                </p>

                <h2>Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Chain-break.<br>
                    Vein-flame.<br>
                    Love, desire, and pain<br>
                    all fed to the same roaring engine.<br><br>

                    I am the roar.<br>
                    I am the rise.<br>
                    I am the storm<br>
                    and the sky<br>
                    it breaks.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Verse / Ascension</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel the roar<br>
                    of centuries-old power<br>
                    moving through chambers<br>
                    of stone<br>
                    and fire.<br><br>

                    The dream of who I was,<br><br>

                    who I am,<br>
                    and who I am becoming...<br>
                    unleashed.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Line / Drop</h2>
                <p>
                    The crescendo<br>
                    of raw fury<br>
                    and power<br>
                    unleashed<br>
                    I have become.
                </p>
