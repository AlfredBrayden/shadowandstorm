                <h1>Track 3 – Rage Into Light</h1>
                <p><em>Lyrics by Chris Gabriel</em></p>

                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel the earth winds swirl about me<br>
                    Carrying echoes of what I can't outrun<br>
                    I feel the rage press behind my teeth<br>
                    Like a lion denied the sun
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    There's silence in the still lake's face<br>
                    But underneath—<br>
                    A flood that never found its scream<br>
                    I wear my peace like broken glass<br>
                    Held together by the seams
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me bleed through the drain of existence<br>
                    Let me roar where the quiet used to live<br>
                    Break these chains that call themselves mercy<br>
                    I've got nothing left to give—<br>
                    But the fire
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel the fracture deep in the steel<br>
                    A crack in the calm I was forced to feel<br>
                    I feel the silence pulling tight<br>
                    Like it's choking out the right to fight
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    There's thunder buried in my chest<br>
                    Kept from striking<br>
                    Kept repressed<br>
                    But this calm's a lie I can't protect<br>
                    And this mask is breaking next
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Let me bleed through the drain of existence<br>
                    Let me roar where the quiet used to live<br>
                    Break these chains that call themselves mercy<br>
                    I've got nothing left to give—<br>
                    But the fire
                </p>

                <h2>Bridge / Build-Up</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel the power<br>
                    I feel the rage<br>
                    I feel the pain<br>
                    Breaking the cage<br>
                    I feel the fracture<br>
                    I feel the weight<br>
                    I feel the scream<br>
                    Behind the gate<br>
                    Let it open<br>
                    Let it fall<br>
                    Let the fire take it all
                </p>

                <h2>Final Chorus / Awakening</h2>
                <p>
                    Rage into light<br>
                    Burning the stain<br>
                    Breaking the chains<br>
                    That carried my name<br>
                    No more silence<br>
                    No more shame<br>
                    I rise from the fire<br>
                    Reborn in flame
                </p>

                <h2>Outro – Spoken / Fading</h2>
                <p>
                    You called it anger—<br>
                    But it was the key.<br>
                    You called it breaking—<br>
                    But it was me finally free. </p>
