                <h1>Track 2 – Welcome to the Shadow</h1>
                <p><em>Lyrics by Chris Gabriel</em></p>

                <h2>Intro – Spoken / Whispered</h2>
                <p>
                    "It's not the dark you fear.<br>
                    It's what you buried there."
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 1</h2>
                <p>
                    Woke up knee-deep in a version of me,<br>
                    Carved from silence and things I refused to see.<br>
                    I played strong, but I fractured in code,<br>
                    Now I walk through the weight I once offloaded.
                </p>

                <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    Truth ain't loud—it waits in the quiet,<br>
                    Whispers crawl through a soul on a diet.<br>
                    Of lies, of light, of looking away—<br>
                    But here in the shadow, I finally stay.
                </p>

                <h2>Chorus</h2>
                <p>
                    It's dark and there is no Grue,<br>
                    Just you and the echo of what you never knew.<br>
                    You were zoomed out without ever zooming in,<br>
                    Blind to the place where the truth begins.<br>
                    Welcome to the Shadow...<br>
                    Where silence finally speaks.<br>
                    Welcome to the Shadow...<br>
                    Where the fragments find their peak.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Every thought I rejected now stands in line,<br>
                    Begging for context, whispering "redefine."<br>
                    These aren't ghosts—just parts of me paused,<br>
                    Held in the code of emotional laws.
                </p>

                <h2>Bridge – Spoken Word / Breakdown</h2>
                <p>
                    Roll the noise back in... re-cut the dough...<br>
                    New patterns emerge where the lost pieces go.<br>
                    This isn't a fall—it's the blueprint reformed,<br>
                    A storm made of self... and now I'm reborn.<br><br>

                    This isn't fear.<br>
                    This isn't failure.<br>
                    This is the place where the pieces remember they're whole.<br>
                    Where the patterns reform and the fragments call your name.<br>
                    You didn't lose yourself...<br>
                    You just hadn't arrived yet.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Chorus – Full Power</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the Shadow...<br>
                    Where silence finally speaks.<br>
                    Welcome to the Shadow...<br>
                    Where the fragments find their peak.<br>
                    It's not the dark that breaks you down—<br>
                    It's the truth you buried deep.<br>
                    Welcome to the Shadow...<br>
                    Now get ready to breathe.
                </p>

                <h2>Outro – Spoken / Fading</h2>
                <p>
                    No map. No guide. Just the fire that wouldn't die.<br><br>
                    You walked alone. You didn't ask why.<br>
                    You built the light from your own echo.<br>
                    Welcome... to the Shadow.
                </p>
